# basic-mask-data
searching mask data in your terminal/cmd

## introduction
Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, at 2020/2/15, Taiwan government requisitioned mask factories in Taiwan, and distributed masks with a high control to maintain the price of masks. Until now, each person can only purchase 3 masks per week.

This approach was effective, and the price of a mask is between 6 - 12 NT.

However, it also derives a new problem. Because each one can only buy 3 masks, people would line up to pharmacies to get those 3 masks.

So, this program is to help you find out which pharmacy ia available for masks ðŸ˜„

## how to run this program
